    normalization/: this directory has the program which will normalize the sequence.
    serial/: this diretory realizes the serial query by humming under SPRING algorithm.
    parallel/: this directory is the parallel version of SPRING algorighm.
    mysound.tar.gz: this archive file has the 100 humming clips.
    query.tar.gz: this archive file has the melody of humming clips.
    sequence.tar.gz: this archive file has the melody of 400 polyphonic music clips.
